## Turn ##

# The public URIs of the TURN server to give to clients
turn_uris:
 - "turn:turn.cyphar.com:3478?transport=udp"
 - "turn:turn.cyphar.com:3478?transport=tcp"

# The shared secret used to compute passwords for the TURN server
turn_shared_secret: "@@TURN_SECRET@@"

# The Username and password if the TURN server needs them and
# does not use a token
#turn_username: "TURNSERVER_USERNAME"
#turn_password: "TURNSERVER_PASSWORD"

# How long generated TURN credentials last
turn_user_lifetime: "1h"

# Whether guests should be allowed to use the TURN server.
# This defaults to True, otherwise VoIP will be unreliable for guests.
# However, it does introduce a slight security risk as it allows users to
# connect to arbitrary endpoints without having first signed up for a
# valid account (e.g. by passing a CAPTCHA).
turn_allow_guests: False
