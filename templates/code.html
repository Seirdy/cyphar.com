<h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2>
<p>One of my greater passions is contributing to free software projects, to help
improve the lives of developers and users around the world. The following is a
list of projects I have contributed to (and continue to actively contribute to).</p>

<dl>
{% for contrib in contribs %}
	<dt>

			{% else %}
				<a>{{ name }}</a>
			{% endif %}

			{# Slashes #}
			{% if not loop.last %}
				/
			{% endif %}
		{% endfor %}

		{% if contrib.language %}

{% endfor %}
</dl>

<h2 id="competitions">Competitions</h2>
