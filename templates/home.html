<h2>Hello, world!</h2>
<p>I'm <b>Aleksa Sarai</b>, and this is my slice of internet real estate.
I'm an undergraduate student at <a href="https://sydney.edu.au/">The University of Sydney</a>,
and have had an interest in both the physical and computer sciences from a very young age.</p>

<p>I've been known to <a href="{{ url_for("code") }}">write code</a> for my own
enjoyment and edification. I also like to <a href="{{ url_for("security") }}">hack things</a>
for fun and profit. In addition, I love nerding out and <a href={{ url_for("blog") }}>blogging</a>
about any really interesting problem I've decided to put my mind to. I've written
and coauthored <a href="{{ url_for("papers") }}">several papers</a> based on research
I've done at the University of Sydney.</p>

<h3>Who are you?</h3>

<p>First and foremost, I am a "designated communications provider" under
&sect;317C(6) of the Telecommunications Act 1997 (<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2018A00148">as amended by the Assistance and Access Act 2018</a>).
Any and all backdoors written by myself are courtesy of the Australian
Government (in their infinite wisdom).</p>

<p>Under &sect;317ZF(13), I am permitted to disclose aggregated statistics of
how many notices I've been given within a 6-month period. I am still in the
process of getting legal advice on <em>precisely</em> how this should be done
in practice. All of the work I do is on free software projects, and thus the
source code is available for auditing. I hope you don't assume I've been
compromised by a government that has no idea what it's doing.</p>

<p>In addition to being a potential spy, I am ... </p>

<ul class="dots">
	<li>a <b>programmer</b>.</li>
	<li>a <b>security researcher</b>.</li>
	<li>a <b>GNU/Linux enthusiast</b>.</li>
	<li>a <b>science enthusiast</b>.</li>
	<li>an developer at SUSE.</li>
</ul>

<p>And I use vim.</p>
